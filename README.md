# Indoor Environment Mapping Robot (IEMR)
Robots can facilitate rescue operations by entering spaces that are dangerous or inaccessible. These robots usually make use of a camera to confer visibility to users. It is advantageous to also map the environment through the use of LIDAR sensors. This provides a geometric model which can be used in real time or throughout a mission. Example scenarios include:

* Searching for imperilled individuals in a burning building
* Searching for buried individuals in rubble
* Searching for hostages and suspects in a law enforcement situation

A simple wheel based solution has been used for movement. Combining the lidar mapping concept with more sophisticated movement to overcome difficult terrain would yield a more practical robot, but is outside the scope of this project.

## Minimum Requirements:
* Acquisition of 3D mapping of the environment using Lidar and SLAM
* Rendering of the environment in VR
* Remote control of the robot in VR
